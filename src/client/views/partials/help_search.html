			<h4>How to search?</h4>
			<p>You can add any number of registered players to your search queries by selecting them by name or PFS number in the search player bar. After you select a player, press enter to select a second one, and so on. You can remove players from your search again by clicking/pressing their name under the add player bar.</p>
			<p>For the players you have selected the sessiontracker will make sure to filter out any content they have already played based on what they have reported (see the report page) as having played.</p>
			<p>Example: <i>Bob has played 50 scenarios, if someone selects Bob as a search criteria the sessiontracker will filter out all 50 of the scenarios Bob has played already.</i></p>
			<p>The content that is left will get detailed information about if the selected players have GMed it already or perhaps played it in a different campaign.</p>

			<p>You can also add a GM. You can only add one GM and it will not filter out any content GMed by the selected GM. It will, however, show you if a GM has already run some content or not. Handy information to make a good decision.</p>
