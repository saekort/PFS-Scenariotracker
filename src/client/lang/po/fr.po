"Pathfinder Society has two types of campaign: 'Pathfinder Society' and "
"'Core'. The 'Core' campaign restricts players to use only content from the "
"core rulebook, for more information see the current season guide. The big "
"plus of these campaigns is that you can play a scenario twice, once in the "
"PFS campaign and once in the CORE campaign. The sessiontracker will compare "
"the player progress of each player with the specific campaign you are "
"searching in.<br>Example: <i>I am looking for a nice scenario to run, but "
"cannot find anything my 6 players have not already played. So I press 'core'"
" and find out that most of them have not played a lot of the core campaign "
"yet. I select a scenario and inform my players that it is the best I can do."
