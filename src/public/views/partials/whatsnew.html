			<h3><span class="fa fa-fw fa-male"></span> Character page changes</h3>
			<p>You can now keep track of SFS characters. Note that they do not get to choose a faction.</p>

			<p>Instead of a dropdown you can now just give a character a number (up to 11 positions!). So that should (hopefully) be enough.</p>

			<p>A bug was fixed that would not allow you to correct the campaign of a character after it was created.</p>
			
			<h3><span class="fa fa-fw fa-lock"></span> Security</h3>
			<p>More security measures were added under the hood.</p>
